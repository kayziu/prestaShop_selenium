# prestaShop_selenium
This is Selenium automation script in Java that tests features on online shop page called PrestaShop.
I am using Cucumber, PageFactory and Gherkin in Page Object Pattern framework.
Feel free to send any suggestions or issues you have found regarding that code.

Script was made during my automation course in CodersLab school.
